# TagProRandomFlairs

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BobSmithIV/TagProRandomFlairs/master/Random%20Flairs.PNG)

This userscript will automatically choose a random flair for you to wear each game. 

Only flairs you've earned will be available (obviously).  You can choose which of your flairs to include in the flair rotation by going to your profile page and selecting only those which you wish to use.

Note that this flair is **not** compatible with my [favicon flair userscript](https://github.com/BobSmithIV/TagProFaviconFlair), so I've merged that userscript's functionality into this one.  To set your favicon to your currently selected flair, select the 'Change favicon' checkbox at the bottom of your flairs on your profile, otherwise, the default favicon is kept by default.  

To install this script:
On Chrome: Ensure you have [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) installed, then simply select the [userscript](https://github.com/BobSmithIV/TagProRandomFlairs/blob/master/TagProRandomFlairs.user.js)  and click raw.  Tampermonkey should then automatically install the userscript for you.  

On Firefox: As above, but you should have [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-Us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) installed rather than Tampermonkey.  

*****

Last updated 3/8/15.  As of v3.0, it should automatically detect what flairs you have and therefore doesn't need an update for each new flair added.
