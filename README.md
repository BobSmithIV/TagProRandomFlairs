# TagProRandomFlairs
This userscript will automatically choose a random flair for you to wear each game. Only flairs you've earned will be available (obviously).  Note that one feature to be aware of is that it won't change your flair if you're PUB-ing in a group.  

To install this script:
On Chrome: Ensure you have [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) installed, then simply select the Chrome version above and click raw.  Tampermonkey should then automatically install the userscript for you.  

On Firefox: As above, but you should have Greasemonkey installed rather than Tampermonkey, and obviously you should choose the Firefox version above.  

You can customize the userscript and choose which of your flairs to include in the flair rotation by simply editing the section at the start of the userscript.

Last updated 9/2.  Compatible with all flairs up to and including the 2nd birthday event flairs.
